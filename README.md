# Exec Dynamic Code Loading

Android app used for exploiting applications vulnerable to dynamic code loading from shared directories (e.g. external storage).
Once the app is compiled, retrieve the APK and put it into the external storage of the device. When the vulnerable app will load it, anyone can access its private directory since the related permissions were changed.
